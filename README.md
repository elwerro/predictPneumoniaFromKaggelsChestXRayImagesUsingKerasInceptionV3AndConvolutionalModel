predict Pneumonia From Kaggels Chest X Ray Images Using Keras InceptionV3 And Convolutional Model


I was only able to run https://github.com/anjanatiha/Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning this code as is and got a different result, and uploaded the run I did as a jupyter notebook, which used the custom convolutional model. I am trying to run the inception v3 model in that code but I am getting alot of errors.
