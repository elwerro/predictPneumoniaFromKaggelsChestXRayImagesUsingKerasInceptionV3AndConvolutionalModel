predict Pneumonia From Kaggels Chest X Ray Images Using Keras InceptionV3 And Convolutional Model

First download a copy of this link to your computer
https://github.com/anjanatiha/Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning


Download the chest x ray dataset from kaggle from this link 
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia#


Create a folder named "data" inside the "code" folder

Create a folder named "input" inside the "data" folder

Create a folder named "output" inside the "data" folder

Move the dataset from kaggle inside the "input" folder. So now there should only be three folders inside the "input" folder named "test", "train", and "val"

Inside the "output" folder, create three folders named "figures", "logs", and "models"


# dependencies
Install jupyter notebook

Install Python 3.6

Install all of the dependencies from the requirements3.txt


# result

I was only able to run https://github.com/anjanatiha/Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-with-Deep-Learning this code as is and got a different result, and uploaded the run I did as a jupyter notebook, which used the custom convolutional model. I am trying to run the inception v3 model in that code but I am getting an errors that I have yet to find out how to fix.

I want to upload another jupyter notebook that has the results from using the inception v3 model
